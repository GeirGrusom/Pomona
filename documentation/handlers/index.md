# What's a handler?

In Pomona a handler class is where an application defines how a HTTP request
will be handled. This is what would be called a "controller" in many other web frameworks.

We'll typically define one handler class per resource type. This can be done by either
using the `HandledBy<T>(..)` method of the fluent configuration API, or by overriding
the `GetResourceHandlers` convention.

Methods in the handler class are duck-typed, and resolved using their name
and signature.

A handler is instantiated using the IoC container associated with the processed
`NancyContext`.

When desired, multiple handler classes for can be defined for a resource type. For example
one class per HTTP action.

# Types of handler methods

## Query handlers

The Query handlers are used for `GET` requests to resource collections. They are required
to return an `IQueryable<T>`.

They must follow the naming pattern `Get{Resources}` or `Query{Resources}`, where
`{Resources}` must be the plural name of the resource type. Or, if the handler class
is only used for one type, it can simply be called `Query`.

<[sample:dusty-game-console-handler]>

Here a `GET` request to /game-consoles would be routed to the `Query()` method of the
handler type.

## Get single resource by id

A method named `Get{Resource}` or `Get` that takes the id as its first argument and
returns a resource of the correct type will handle `GET` requests for resources by id.

Note that by default this method is implemented by using the query handler,
so in many cases manually implementing this method is redundant.

## Post resource

A method named `Post` or `Post{Resource}` taking the deserialized resource as a
parameter will be used for handling `POST` requests .

## Patch resource

A method named `Patch` or `Patch{Resource}` receives the fully patched resource
on a `PATCH`.

Pomona uses a custom JSON patch format, more details can be found in

## Delete resource

A method named `Delete` or `Delete{Resource}` that either takes a resource
or id parameter will be used for `DELETE` requests.
